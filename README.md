Goal/What the Application Does:

Create a Monte Carlo finance simulator that can
1. accomodate discrete and normally distributed random variables and 
2. randomly generated numbers based on a previously generated random number.

Input:
1. Any discrete or normally distributed values (standard deviation, mean, etc)
2. N Number of simulations
3. Certain values, such as starting balance, interest rates etc

Output:
1. N number of simulated outcomes
2. Histogram of outcomes
